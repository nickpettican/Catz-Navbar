The navbar was built for a dark coloured landing page header, with the starting text colour being `white` and the `background: transparent`. As you scroll down, the navbar collapses into a `height: 50px` and `background-color: white` navbar with `a` and `navbar-brand` in black. 

It includes a menu burger when `width < 768px`, and when clicked, the navbar also collapses into the 50px white version if it hasn't collapsed already. The menu burger is also animated, turning the three lines into an `X` and back.

## Page scroll
The JS behing the navbar also includes a scroll animation function for elements of class `page-scroll`. 

## Customise
Customisation has to be done taking both the CSS and JS into account. Future development will include different options by defining classes.

## Why Catz?
I wanted to test the navbar on a site and I had already built a landing page website with empty boxes. So to make the experience more pleasant, I took some cat photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/cats).
